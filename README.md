###px:Notation

**px:Notation** system is a specific data structure and a set of tools that allow deep & comprehensive description of digital & time based artworks.
 
 The aim of the notation system is to record work-defining properties, its conceptual dependencies, aesthetics, and behavior in a form of a standardized but flexible and extensible metadata. 
 
 px:Notation is a work in progress with the ultimate goal to develop an universal and expressive language of notation which could allow authors to record and preserve their artistic intentions which could be accurately translated to different equipment and exhibiting contexts. 

**px:Notation** is inspired by Richard Rinehart's Media Art Notation System and Variable Media Initiative and the Media Art Documentation Iteration Report of the Guggenheim Museum.
